## nurj website

This is the app powering the nurj website. This project uses [prismic](https://prismic.io) as the CMS backend and pug templates to render files.

## get started
Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). The recommended way of doing this is through [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Once you have npm, type the following into your command line:
```
npm clone git@github.com:nurj/nurj.git
cd nurj
npm install
npm start
```

The project will recompile your files as you make changes.

### Miscellaneous tech stuff
Our domain is [thenurj.com](http://www.thenurj.com). Our website was previously hosted on Squarespace, and the legacy site is still available at [nurj.squarespace.com](https://nurj.squarespace.com). That site will continue to stay up as an archive in case we need to go back and retreive any information, but it will not and should not be updated.

Our domain is registered through Google Domains, and our account is accessible through the NURJ email.
